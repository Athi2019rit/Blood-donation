-As big data becomes more prevalent, the demand for intelligent and automated systems has increased. This requirement is most acute in the sector of health care, particularly in the area of blood transfusion, which requires supplies as soon as possible.
Transfusion services are now largely manual, which is inefficient. The blood donation supply chain has been put under a lot of strain as demand for blood has increased and donation rates have decreased. As a result, developing intelligent systems capable of making decisions and improving communication across the supply chain is critical.Â We will provide a broad overview of the many machine learning approaches that have been used in this sector and assess their benefits and drawbacks.
